# HRData-Regression
Linear Regression is simple but powereful method to predict a quantitative value from a set of independent varibles. The objective of this notebook is to analyze 
Human Resources data of employees that have left a company. I will use different regression methods to transform data and derive a model that can accurately predict 
the amount of years an employee will stay with the company. This is a fictional data set that contains information about employees like age, job role, and education. The Attrition column designates that an employee has left the company as ‘Yes’.  The YearsAtCompany feature describes how long the employee has worked for the company. The analysis in this notebook will find the best model to predict YearsAtCompany for employees that have left the company.
