# HRData-Regression
Linear Regression is simple but powereful method to predict a quantitative value from a set of independent varibles. I will analyze Human Resources data 
of employees that have left a company. I will use different regression methods to transform data and derive a model that can accurately predict the amount of years 
an employee will stay with the company. This will benefit stakeholders because Human Resources can identify the factors that influence the turnover rate and find ways 
to prevent employees from leaving the organization. This is a fictional data set that contains information about employees like age, job role, and education. 
The Attrition column designates that an employee has left the company as ‘Yes’.  The YearsAtCompany feature describes how long the employee has worked for the company. 
I will find the best model to predict the YearsAtCompany feature for employees that have left the company.
